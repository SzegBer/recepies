# Recipe browser react app
This is my very first react app. My goal was to practice how to think in react, and how to use dynamic data display.

This website displays some recipes that are fetched from an online REST API.
The fetched data is based on filter options, wich can be chosed in the upper section of the website.
The options and filters are dinamically injected from an inner database so it is very easy to add new filter options.
